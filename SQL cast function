Identify users who started a session and placed an order on the same day. For these users, calculate the total number of orders and the total order value for that day. Your output should include the user, the session date, the total number of orders, and the total order value for that day.
---- Solution
CREATE TABLE sessions(session_id INT, user_id INT, session_date DATETIME);

INSERT INTO sessions (session_id, user_id, session_date) VALUES (1, 1, '2024-01-01'), (2, 2, '2024-01-02'), (3, 3, '2024-01-05'), (4, 3, '2024-01-05'), (5, 4, '2024-01-03'), (6, 4, '2024-01-03'), (7, 5, '2024-01-04'), (8, 5, '2024-01-04'), (9, 3, '2024-01-05'), (10, 5, '2024-01-04');

CREATE TABLE order_summary (order_id INT, user_id INT, order_value INT, order_date DATETIME);

INSERT INTO order_summary (order_id, user_id, order_value, order_date) VALUES (1, 1, 152, '2024-01-01'), (2, 2, 485, '2024-01-02'), (3, 3, 398, '2024-01-05'), (4, 3, 320, '2024-01-05'), (5, 4, 156, '2024-01-03'), (6, 4, 121, '2024-01-03'), (7, 5, 238, '2024-01-04'), (8, 5, 70, '2024-01-04'), (9, 3, 152, '2024-01-05'), (10, 5, 171, '2024-01-04');

select * from sessions
select * from order_summary

--solution
  
select s.user_id, cast(s.session_date as Date)as session_date,count(o.order_id)as total_order,sum(o.order_value)as total_number_of_orders from sessions s
join order_summary o on s.user_id=o.user_id where cast(s.session_date as Date)= cast(o.order_date as date) group by s.user_id,cast(s.session_date as Date) 
order by s.user_id,session_date







---Explanation of changes:
---Join Condition: The CAST(s.session_date AS DATE) = CAST(o.order_date AS DATE) condition is moved into the ON clause of the JOIN for clarity, ensuring that the join happens only when both the session date and order date match after casting.
---GROUP BY Clause: It groups by both s.user_id and the cast session_date, which is correct because you're aggregating by these fields.
---Ordering: The query orders the results by s.user_id and session_date, which should give you the results in a user-wise chronological order.
--This query will provide the total count of orders (total_order) and the total value of orders (total_number_of_orders) for each user on each session date.
